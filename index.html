        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! I'm Tommy Ly, a dedicated computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin, driven by a passion for turning ideas into tangible solutions through coding. My journey in computer science has been an exploration of diverse domains, from game development to web development and data science.
        I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I am committed to honing my skills to contribute meaningfully to this transformative field. As I progress through my academic journey, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.
        Outside of academics, I am an active member of various clubs and organizations, including Freetail Hackers, Electronic Game Developers Society, and UTCS Competitive Programming Club. These experiences not only enrich my learning but also allow me to collaborate with peers who share my enthusiasm for technology.
        With a solid foundation in languages such as Python, C, C++, and Java, as well as experience with technologies like Git, Godot Engine, and data science tools, I am equipped to tackle complex problems and bring innovative ideas to life.
        Driven by a desire to make a positive impact, I have undertaken internships, such as my role as an Electric Vehicle Customer Solutions Intern at Ford Motor Company, where I identified and addressed customer issues, demonstrating my ability to apply my skills in real-world settings. As I look towards the future,
        I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the world of computer science. Whether it's developing captivating games, building intuitive web applications, or delving into the depths of data analysis, I am eager to continue my journey of learning, growth, and innovation.
